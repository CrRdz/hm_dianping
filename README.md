A simplified clone of **Dianping** (similar to Yelp/Dianping apps).  
This project implements key features such as SMS login, store reviews, coupon flash sales, daily check-ins, user follow system, follower/blog subscriptions, and more.  
Users can browse recommended content on the homepage, search for nearby merchants, view store details and reviews, post exploration blogs, and grab limited-time flash sale products.
